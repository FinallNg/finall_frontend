# Finall Frontend

## After cloning the repository
- Run npm install (to install neccessary dependencies)
- Run git checkout dev 
- This will switch you to the dev branch
- After finishing your work (ensure to only work in the folder relating to your work)
- git add .
- git commit -m "Your Commit Message"
- Then pull update from dev by using git pull origin dev
- If there is conflict, fix it, otherwise you can go ahead to push your work
- git push origin dev

## Thanks
